## A word of warning

Many people are getting `Action Blocked` message these days with this bot as well as other bots (it seems even people just manually following using the app) Instagram is tightening their rules by not allowing promiscuous behavior like following and liking strangers' photos as much as before, and imposing temp blocks when they think you crossed the limit.

**You use this app at your own risk! I have had great success with this app but I am not responsible for any consequences it may have for your Instagram account.**

## Tips to avoid ban

I advise you to follow these guidelines:

- Run the bot on the same internet connection (e.g. WiFi) as you normally use your phone with the Instagram mobile app. It will reduce the chance of being flagged
- Use conservative parameters (max follows/unfollows per day 150 and max 20 per hour, maybe even start lower, and work your way up)
